### Hi there 👋

### 🛠️ Things I Built:

1. 🍏 MacroMe (coming soon)
    - A mobile app for tracking calories with AI suggestions and meal adjustments.

2. 🗒️ Note Migrator
    - My old phone notes lost categories and were saved as HTML + JSON, so I made a CLI tool to convert them to markdown and categorize them.

3. 🌐 Client Websites & Apps
    - Building stuff that I like/need ain't making bread, so I made a bunch of marketing websites for clients and even some apps.
